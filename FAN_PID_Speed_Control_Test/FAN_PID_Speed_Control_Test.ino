/*
 * The logic here is as follows ...
 * The 5 sensor readings tell us that the temperature at the outside of the oven is always warmer and the temp at the center.
 * We believe this is true because the fan is pushing all the warm air to the outside when running at full speed.
 * If we slow down the fan we believe that we will even out the temperature.
 * The PID will adjust the firing delay on the fan so that the error between the two temps will be zero.
